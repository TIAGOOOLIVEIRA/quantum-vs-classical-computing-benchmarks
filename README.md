# Quantum vs Classical Computing Benchmarks

## Purpose

This repository explores quantum computing algorithms in comparison with classical ones to optimize and explore the limits of new technologies. The goal is to benchmark and analyze the performance differences between quantum and classical approaches for various computational problems.

## Structure

Each algorithm is organized in its own folder with dedicated documentation:

- **[travelling-salesman-problem](./travelling-salesman-problem/)** - Exploring graph traversal and shortest path optimization
- **[prime-factorization](./prime-factorization/)** - Cryptography-focused prime number factorization algorithms

## Algorithms

### 1. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Focus on graph theory and shortest path optimization, comparing quantum and classical approaches to this NP-hard problem.

### 2. Prime Factorization
Exploring cryptographic applications by comparing classical and quantum factorization methods, including implementations relevant to RSA encryption security.

## Getting Started

Navigate to each algorithm's folder for specific implementation details, benchmarks, and comparisons between quantum and classical approaches.
